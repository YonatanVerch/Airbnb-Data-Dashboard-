# Airbnb Data Analysis & Interactive Tableau Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Airbnb listing data using **Tableau**, focusing on pricing behavior, availability patterns, property characteristics, and geographic distribution.  
The analysis is based on **3,818 Airbnb listings** and is delivered through an interactive dashboard designed to support data-driven exploration and insight generation.

##  Repository Contents
- `AirBnb Full Project.twb` – Tableau workbook containing dashboards, calculated fields, and filters  
- `Tableau Full Project.xlsx` – Dataset used for analysis

##  Tools & Technologies
- **Tableau** – Interactive dashboards and visual analytics  
- **Microsoft Excel** – Data storage and preprocessing  

## Key Analytical Findings

 **Dataset scope:**  
  Analysis includes **3,818 Airbnb listings** with pricing, availability, room type, and location attributes.

- **Pricing distribution:**  
  - **Average nightly price:** ~$128  
  - **Median nightly price:** ~$100  
  The gap between mean and median indicates a **right-skewed distribution**, driven by higher-priced premium listings.

- **Room type composition:**  
  - **Entire home/apartment:** ~66.6% of listings  
  - **Private room:** ~30.4%  
  - **Shared room:** ~3.0%  
  Entire homes account for the majority of listings and dominate the higher price ranges.

- **Availability patterns:**  
  - **Average availability:** ~245 days per year  
  This suggests a mix of full-time rental properties and short-term or seasonal listings.

- **Price vs. availability relationship:**  
  Higher-priced listings generally exhibit **lower availability**, consistent with demand-driven and premium pricing behavior.

- **Geographic concentration:**  
  Listings are highly concentrated in central, high-demand neighborhoods, where **average prices are noticeably higher** than in peripheral areas.
